One of these challenges is detecting a loop within them. Over the years, many algorithms have been devised to address this issue, from Floyd&amp;rsquo;s Cycle Detection algorithm (also known as the &amp;ldquo;Tortoise and the Hare&amp;rdquo; algorithm) to various hashing techniques. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re exploring a novel approach rooted in the mechanics of memory allocation.</description></item><item><title>Top Github Commands that you should know</title><link>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/git-commands-that-you-should-know/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 15:10:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/git-commands-that-you-should-know/</guid><description>GitHub Commands Tutorial Table of Contents Configuring GitHub Creating a New Repository Cloning a Repository Adding Files to a Repository Committing Changes Pushing Changes to GitHub Pulling the Latest Version from GitHub Creating a New Branch Switching Between Branches Merging Branches Configuring GitHub Before using Git commands, make sure to configure your GitHub account.

One such algorithm, which originated from the video game industry, offers a rapid method to compute the inverse square root of a floating-point number. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s unravel the beauty behind this fascinating piece of code.
Introduction The Fast Inverse Square Root algorithm, sometimes lovingly referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Quake&amp;rdquo; algorithm due to its association with the game, is a method that uses bit-level operations to quickly approximate the inverse square root of a given float.</description></item><item><title>Database Sharding</title><link>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/database-sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 15:10:43 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/database-sharding/</guid><description>What is Database Sharding Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts. These smaller parts are called data shards. The word shard means &amp;ldquo;a small part of a whole.&amp;rdquo;
Horizontal Vs vertical sharding: To achieve sharding, the rows or columns of a larger database table are split into multiple smaller tables.
When we split using rows : Horizontal Sharding
When we split using columns : Vertical Sharding</description></item><item><title>Database Replication'</title><link>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/database_replication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 15:10:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/database_replication/</guid><description>Understanding Database Replication in System Design Introduction Database replication is a technique used to maintain the same data across different databases. The primary goal is to ensure data reliability, redundancy, and availability. In system design, replication is crucial for preventing data loss, load balancing, and improving local data access speed. It is a fundamental concept often discussed during interviews related to system design.
Database Replication Types There are three main types of database replication:</description></item></channel></rss>
