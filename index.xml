Start at the position A, and expand in all possible directions (up, down, left, right), but only if the destination cell is accessible (not a wall) and unvisited. While doing BFS, maintain a parent map to keep track of the cell from where we reached the current cell.</description></item><item><title>Top 50 Graph Questions</title><link>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/top-50_graph_problems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 15:10:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/top-50_graph_problems/</guid><description>Top 50 Graph Problems Looking to master graph theory and solve graph problems efficiently?

These smaller parts are called data shards. The word shard means &amp;ldquo;a small part of a whole.&amp;rdquo;
Horizontal Vs vertical sharding: To achieve sharding, the rows or columns of a larger database table are split into multiple smaller tables.
When we split using rows : Horizontal Sharding
When we split using columns : Vertical Sharding</description></item><item><title>Top Github Commands that you should know</title><link>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/git-commands-that-you-should-know/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 15:10:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://Vaibhav-sarvashreshth.github.io/blog/posts/git-commands-that-you-should-know/</guid><description>GitHub Commands Tutorial Table of Contents Configuring GitHub Creating a New Repository Cloning a Repository Adding Files to a Repository Committing Changes Pushing Changes to GitHub Pulling the Latest Version from GitHub Creating a New Branch Switching Between Branches Merging Branches Configuring GitHub Before using Git commands, make sure to configure your GitHub account.

The primary goal is to ensure data reliability, redundancy, and availability. In system design, replication is crucial for preventing data loss, load balancing, and improving local data access speed. It is a fundamental concept often discussed during interviews related to system design.
Database Replication Types There are three main types of database replication:</description></item></channel></rss>
